 # BUSINESS OVERVIEW

 DFM Precision Engineering (DFMPE) is a specialized manufacturing company that specializes in high-precision reverse engineering, <AdditiveHoverCard />, <CNCHoverCard /> and <PCBHoverCard />.
 <br/>
 The primary service is to provide **rapid production of critical spare parts**, custom tooling and low volume production components for the mining, energy, automative, agricultural sectors in Botswana and the SADC region. The secondary service is to provide **PCB printing** for the computer, telecommunications industry and regular entities.
 <br/>
 By offering a local, high-quality, and fast PCB delivery network, DFM mitigates logistical and quality control challenges associated with international sourcing, thereby enhancing regional technological resilience and supporting local enterprise development.

 # The problem and solution

 Botswana faces persistent challenges in providing reliable power, which directly affects industrial output due to power outages and loadshedding. This instability is sometimes due to plant and critical machine breakdowns.

DFM Precision Engineering can manufacture critical replacement parts for these generation systems, ensuring faster maintenance and improved grid reliability.
 <br></br>

<NorthSouthCarrierHoverCard /> is a pipeline and water transfer system that transports water from up-north Botswana down to the south, consisting of dams, supervisory control, data acquisition systems, electronics and sensors.

DFMPE could rapidly reverse engineer and manufacture broken out parts using CNC machining, thus reducing downtime which in turn provides a consistent industrial output. The NSC also uses electrical control systems, and DFMPE provides PCB printing (printing of circuit boards for monitoring equipment).

 <br></br>
 This hardware could be produced and repaired locally instead of relying on slow imports. By localizing production of low volume but critical components DFMPE reduces the dependence Botswana has on imports.

DFMPE will also be able to support small to medium enterprises, workshops and schools allowing them to get access to prototype manufacturing. DFMPE can offer rapid and small batch production services allowing enterprises to develop new products without the heavy cost of imports.
 <br/>
 This stimulates entrepreneurship in Botswana which has been a challenge for the country and helps achieve <Vision2036HoverCard/> which is to enhance national productivity and competitiveness.

DFMPE will be in Gaborone – this makes recycling achievable which supports sustainable industrial practices aligned with Botswana’s green growth objectives.

<section id="economic-contribution">
 # DFMPE’s contribution towards Botswana's current economic situation

 Providing a faster and local alternative to airfreighting replacements from overseas, often resulting in weeks or months of waiting. DFM provides local, rapid turnaround for repairs and replacements and helps support <ImportSubstitutionHoverCard/> which in turn helps The Bank of Botswana to retain capital by stabilizing the pula by using majority of the currency on essential imports.

DFMPE will also provide direct and indirect employment opportunities for Botswana’s citizens.

<section id="strategic-location">
 # DFMPE’s strategic business location

 DFMPE will be located near the <BIHHoverCard /> in Gaborone, along the A1 highway which provides:

 - Easy logistics access to the northern and southern parts of the country, closer to A1 by 3km.

 - Proximity to research facilities and startups for collaboration. (University of Botswana by 8km, BIH Research Park and Startups breed by BIH)

 - Great access to electricity and water needed for CNC and PCB operations is also great for the employees too.

 # Market Research/Analysis

 To validate the feasibility of this business I used two methods of data collection, primary and secondary data collection. For primary data collection I used surveys, and this included emailing large utilities and corporations (Botswana Power Corporation, Water Utilities Corporation, Mascom...). Unfortunately, there were no responses from those organizations.

 ## PRIMARY DATA

 Sample Email Survey

 ## SECONDARY DATA

 According to the <IMTSReportHoverCard /> report by Zibo Albert at Statistics Botswana, the following categories are relevant to DFMPE:

<MarketOpportunityChart />

<br/>
Most of these imports are from South Africa, China and the EU at 66%, 6.8% and 5.6% respectively according to Table 3.1A of the IMTS Digest.

Secondary data confirms strong market potential for DFM Precision Engineering. Botswana imports billions of pula worth of machinery, electrical equipment, and metal products each year.

Local production of spare parts, prototypes, and PCBs could substitute imports, reducing downtime in critical industries in which DFMPE could fill this spot.

<section id="funding">
 # Source of funding and interest rates.

DFMPE can source funds from the following:

 - <CEDAHoverCard /> a loan of P 450 000 at an interest rate of 4.25%

 - ABSA loan of P200 000 with a 5% interest rate.

 - Capital from me of P 80 000

In total I need P 730 000 capital.

# Conclusion

The financial analysis of DFMPE shows us that we have a **negative Net Present Value of P 1 365 173** at a 10% discount rate. However, this outcome is not a lack of feasibility because this is common for a newly built manufacturing startup.

DFMPE is a strategically valuable enterprise and addresses Botswana’s industrial challenges, reducing dependence on imported spare parts and components by providing a local manufacturing alternative whilst reducing lead times, saving foreign currency, and improving industrial reliability. The business model also aligns with Botswana’s **Vision 2036 goals** of enhancing productivity, competitiveness, and innovation-led growth.
