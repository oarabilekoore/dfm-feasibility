## 📖 Executive Summary
This project is a digital transformation of a comprehensive feasibility study conducted for **DFM Precision Engineering**, a proposed localized manufacturing hub in Gaborone, Botswana.

The study addresses the critical challenge of **supply chain fragility** in Botswana's mining, energy, and water sectors. currently, reliance on imported spares causes significant downtime for entities like the **Water Utilities Corporation (WUC)** and **Botswana Power Corporation (BPC)**. This project proposes a local CNC machining and reverse engineering solution to mitigate these risks.

## 📊 Key Features of this Report
Unlike static PDF reports, this interactive web version features:
* **Dynamic Financial Visualizations:** Interactive Bar and Line charts visualizing Revenue vs. Expenses and ROI growth over a 5-year period.
* **Data-Driven Market Analysis:** Integration of import data from *Statistics Botswana (June 2025)* to validate market size.
* **Business Logic:** A complete breakdown of Net Present Value (NPV) calculations and startup capital requirements.

## 🛠 Engineering & Business Logic
This project demonstrates the intersection of mechanical engineering and business strategy:
* [cite_start]**Problem Identification:** Diagnosed failure points in the North South Carrier (NSC) pipeline and power generation systems due to lack of spare parts[cite: 20, 23].
* [cite_start]**Technical Solution:** Proposed a facility for high-precision CNC milling, industrial 3D printing, and PCB fabrication[cite: 14].
* [cite_start]**Financial Modeling:** Calculated a 5-year trajectory moving from a **-69.8% ROI** in Year 1 to **+98.0% ROI** in Year 5[cite: 129].

## 💻 Technical Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap 5 for responsive design).
* **Data Visualization:** Chart.js (Rendering financial datasets dynamically).
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

## 📈 Project Data Snapshot
* [cite_start]**Initial Capital Required:** P730,000 (Sourced via CEDA, ABSA, and Personal Equity) [cite: 83-86].
* [cite_start]**Target Market:** Machinery & Electrical Equipment Imports (~P12.77 Billion/year)[cite: 75].
* [cite_start]**Projected NPV:** -P1,365,173 (at 10% discount rate), typical for capital-intensive manufacturing startups[cite: 141, 144].
