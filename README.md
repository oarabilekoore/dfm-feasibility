## Overview  
This repository contains an interactive version of a feasibility study originally completed as part of GEME 201 (Introduction to Small Business Management and Accounting) at the Botswana International University of Science and Technology (BIUST).

The interactive article transforms the formal report into a modern, accessible presentation. It demonstrates skills in technical communication, engineering understanding, financial modelling, and digital presentation.

## About the Study  
The feasibility report examines the viability of establishing **DFM Precision Engineering (DFMPE)**, a company focused on:

- CNC machining  
- Additive manufacturing (3D printing)  
- Reverse engineering  
- PCB printing and electronics prototyping  

The study highlights the potential for DFMPE to strengthen Botswana’s industrial resilience, reduce reliance on imported components, and contribute to Vision 2036 goals through innovation-led growth.

## Features of the Interactive Article  
- Clean, mobile-friendly design  
- Section-by-section navigation  
- Enhanced visuals and improved readability  
- Embedded financial tables and simplified charts
